# Rovers on Mars

Is a Single Page Application based on the use of Application Programming Interface

## Description

This single-page app was created to give users a simple way to access three different Mars rovers’ imagery in one single location.

Being a space exploration fan myself, makes me realize that having the three rovers’ imagery on one site would be an easy way to access NASA’s imagery. This was purposely done to facilitate better interaction between users and the data contained along with the photos, hopefully, resulting in an excellent educational resource.

# Goals and future improvements

Future improvements are planned to increase usability. The goals are the following: First short-term goal is to improve the styling and enable interactivity by adding more event listeners. Add information to every photo and provide fixtures such as search or filter functionality to allow the sorting of the information the user wants to see displayed. Give the ability to join correlated pictures to recreate a bigger landscape.
Long-term goals: find viable fixtures to enhance educational interactions.
